If Sentry has access to application source code, it can show snippets of code
around the location of stack frames. Certain SDKs can resolve this source
context automatically, such as the Python SDK, because they have access to
unobfuscated source code at runtime.

To get source context for compiled applications, source code needs to be uploaded
alongside the debug information files.  The recommended way to do this is by using `sentry-cli`.
See [Creating Source Bundles](/product/cli/dif/#creating-source-bundles) for more information.

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]}>

To get source context for compiled applications, source code needs to be uploaded
alongside the debug information files.  For .NET projects, the recommended way to do this is
through the built-in MSBuild properties, as described in the [MSBuild setup](../../../configuration/msbuild/) docs.

Source code shows up as regular debug files on the _Debug Files_ settings
page. They are designated as "source bundle" and feature a `sources` tag. To
match them with crash reports, they carry the same debug file as the respective
debug information file they have been created from.
